The scene merges multiple Pancam exposures taken during the period April 16 through May 15, 2016, corresponding to sols (Martian days) 4,347 through 4,375 of Opportunity&#39;s work on Mars. It spans from north, at the left, to west-southwest, at the right.  The high point in the right half of the scene is &quot;Knudsen Ridge,&quot; which forms part of the southern edge of Marathon Valley. Portions of the northeastern and eastern rim of Endeavour crater appear on the distant horizon. Endeavour Crater is 14 miles (22 kilometers) in diameter. The fractured texture of Marathon Valley&#39;s floor is visible in the foreground.  The view merges exposures taken through three of the Pancam&#39;s color filters, centered on wavelengths of 753 nanometers (near-infrared), 535 nanometers (green) and 432 nanometers (violet). It is presented in approximately true color.  The rover team calls this image the mission&#39;s &quot;Sacagawea Panorama,&quot; for the Lemhi Shoshone woman, also commemorated on U.S. dollar coins, whose assistance to the Lewis and Clark expedition helped enable its successes in 1804-1806. Many rocks and other features in Marathon Valley were informally named for members of Lewis and Clark&#39;s &quot;Corps of Discovery&quot; expedition.  Opportunity entered Marathon Valley in July 2015. The valley&#39;s informal name was chosen because Opportunity&#39;s arrival at this point along the western rim of Endeavour Crater coincided closely with the rover surpassing marathon-footrace distance in its total driving odometry since landing on Mars in January 2004. The team&#39;s planned investigations in the valley were nearing completion when the component images for this scene were taken.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20749</p><p class="meta">Created: 2016-06-14T20:15:01Z | Center: JPL | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA20749/PIA20749~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Mars Rover Opportunity&#39;s View of &#39;Orion Crater&#39; (Stereo)</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA21706/PIA21706~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA21706/PIA21706~medium.jpg" alt="Mars Rover Opportunity&#39;s View of &#39;Orion Crater&#39; (Stereo)"></a><p>This view of a small, relatively fresh crater on Mars combines images from the left eye and right eye of the Panoramic Camera (Pancam) on NASA&#39;s Opportunity Mars rover, to appear three-dimensional when seen through blue-red glasses with the red lens on the left. The rover paused beside the crater in April 2017, during the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 16 mission to the moon. The rover team chose to call it &quot;Orion Crater,&quot; after the Apollo 16 lunar module.  The crater&#39;s diameter is about 90 feet (27 meters). From the small amount of erosion or filling that Orion Crater has experienced, its age is estimated at no more than 10 million years. It lies on the western rim of Endeavour Crater. For comparison, Endeavor is about 14 miles (22 kilometers) in diameter and more than 3.6 billion years old.  The component images were taken on April 26, 2017, during the 4,712th Martian day, or sol, of Opportunity&#39;s work on Mars.   Apollo 16 astronauts John Young and Charles Duke flew in the Orion lunar module to and from the first human landing in the lunar highlands while Ken Mattingly orbited the moon in the command module, Casper. On the moon, Young and Duke investigated Plum Crater, which is approximately the same size as Mars&#39; Orion Crater.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21706</p><p class="meta">Created: 2017-06-16T00:00:00Z | Center: JPL | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA21706/PIA21706~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>That&#39;s One Small Step for a Mars Rover</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA23468/PIA23468~small.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA23468/PIA23468~small.jpg" alt="That&#39;s One Small Step for a Mars Rover"></a><p>This time-lapse video, taken on Oct. 8, 2019, at NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, captures the first time the Mars 2020 rover carries its full weight on its legs and wheels.

The payload bay and tail of the shuttle can be seen on the left hand side of the picture. Auroras are caused when high-energy electrons pour down from the Earth&#39;s magnetosphere and collide with atoms. Red aurora occurs from 200 km to as high as 500 km altitude and is caused by the emission of 6300 Angstrom wavelength light from oxygen atoms. Green aurora occurs from about 100 km to 250 km altitude and is caused by the emission of 5577 Angstrom wavelength light from oxygen atoms. The light is emitted when the atoms return to their original unexcited state. At times of peaks in solar activity, there are more geomagnetic storms and this increases the auroral activity viewed on Earth and by astronauts from orbit.</p><p class="meta">Created: 1991-05-01T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0300804/0300804~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Martian Aurora 25 Times Brighter Than Prior Brightest</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA21857/PIA21857~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA21857/PIA21857~medium.jpg" alt="Martian Aurora 25 Times Brighter Than Prior Brightest"></a><p>These profiles show the brightness of aurora emission in Mars&#39; atmosphere at different altitudes.

The images were obtained by the Solid State Imaging (SSI) system on NASA&#39;s Galileo spacecraft. during its eleventh orbit of Jupiter.  The auroral ring is offset from Jupiter&#39;s pole of rotation and reaches the lowest latitude near 165 degrees west longitude. The aurora is hundreds of kilometers wide, and when it crosses the edge of Jupiter, it is about 250 kilometers above the planet.  As on Earth, the auroral emission is caused by electrically charged particles striking atoms in the upper atmosphere from above. The particles travel along Jupiter&#39;s magnetic field lines, but their origin is not fully understood. The field lines where the aurora is most intense cross the Jovian equator at large distances (many Jovian radii) from the planet. The faint background throughout the image is scattered light in the camera. This stray light comes from the sunlit portion of Jupiter, which is out of the image. In multispectral observations the aurora appears red, consistent with how atomic hydrogen in Jupiter&#39;s atmosphere would glow. Galileo&#39;s unique perspective allows it to view the night side of the planet at short range, revealing details that cannot be seen from Earth. These detailed features are time dependent, and can be followed in this sequence of Galileo images.  In the first mosaic, the auroral ring is directly over Jupiter&#39;s limb and is seen &quot;edge on.&quot; In the fifth mosaic, the auroral emission is coming from several distinct bands. This mosaic also shows the footprint of the Io flux tube. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter&#39;s moon, Io, spew forth particles that become ionized and are pulled into Jupiter&#39;s magnetic field to form an invisible tube, the Io flux tube, between Jupiter and Io. The bright circular feature towards the lower right may mark the location where these energetic particles impact Jupiter. Stars which are visible in some of the images enable precise determination of where the camera is pointed. This has allowed the first three dimensional establishment of the position of the aurora. Surprisingly, the measured height is about half the altitude (above the one bar pressure level) predicted by magnetospheric models.  The Universal Time, in Spacecraft Event Time (SCET), that the images were taken is listed beneath each mosaic. The first four frames were taken on November 5, 1997 (SCET 97.309) before the Galileo spacecraft reached perijove, the closest point to Jupiter. The latter four were taken three days later on November 8, 1997 (SCET 97.312), after perijove. Each image was taken at visible wavelengths and is displayed in shades of blue. North is at the top of the picture. A grid of planetocentric latitude and west longitude is overlain on the images. The resolution in the plane of the pictures is 15 kilometers per picture element. The images were taken at a range of 1.3 million kilometers.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01600</p><p class="meta">Created: 1998-06-10T15:24:55Z | Center: JPL | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA01600/PIA01600~small.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Solar Storm Triggers Whole-Planet Aurora at Mars</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA21855/PIA21855~small.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA21855/PIA21855~small.jpg" alt="Solar Storm Triggers Whole-Planet Aurora at Mars"></a><p>These images show the sudden appearance of a bright aurora on Mars during a solar storm in September 2017.

A simulated image of Mars for the same time and orientation has been added, with the dayside crescent visible on the right. The auroral emission appears brightest at the edges of the planet where the line of sight passes along the length of the glowing atmosphere layer.  The data are from observations by the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph instrument (IUVS) on NASA&#39;s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution orbiter, or MAVEN.  Note that, unlike auroras on Earth, the Martian aurora is not concentrated at the planet&#39;s polar regions. This is because Mars has no strong magnetic field like Earth&#39;s to concentrate the aurora near the poles.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21855</p><p class="meta">Created: 2017-09-29T00:00:00Z | Center: JPL | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA21855/PIA21855~small.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>The aurora borealis blankets the Earth</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss072e159172/iss072e159172~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss072e159172/iss072e159172~medium.jpg" alt="The aurora borealis blankets the Earth"></a><p>iss072e159172 (Oct. 30, 2024) --- The aurora borealis blankets the Earth in this photograph from the International Space Station as it soared 257 miles above Canada&#39;s province of Manitoba.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2024-10-30T00:00:00Z | Center: JSC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss072e159172/iss072e159172~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div></div><div class="category"><h2>Earth_From_Space</h2><div class="item"><h3>American Apollo spacecraft as seen from Soviet Soyuz spacecraft in orbit</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AST-32-2675/AST-32-2675~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AST-32-2675/AST-32-2675~medium.jpg" alt="American Apollo spacecraft as seen from Soviet Soyuz spacecraft in orbit"></a><p>AST-32-2675 (17-19 July 1975) --- The American Apollo spacecraft as seen in Earth orbit from the Soviet Soyuz spacecraft during the joint U.S.-USSR Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission.

This image of the nebula captured by NASA&#39;s Hubble Space Telescope (HST) depicts violent gas collisions that produced supersonic shock fronts in a dying star. Stars, like our sun, will eventually die and expel most of their material outward into shells of gas and dust These shells eventually form some of the most beautiful objects in the universe, called planetary nebulae. The yellow in the image depicts the material ejected from the central star zooming away at speeds up to one and a half million kilometers per hour (one million miles per hour). Due to the high speeds of the gas, shock-fronts are formed on impact and heat the surrounding gas. Although computer calculations have predicted the existence and structure of such shocks for some time, previous observations have not been able to prove the theory.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2001-08-24T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0300724/0300724~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Space Science</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" alt="Space Science"></a><p>This Hubble Space Telescope image reveals a rainbow of colors in this dying star, called IC 446.

We do not see the donut shape in this photograph because we are viewing IC 4406 from the Earth-orbiting HST. From this vantage point, we are seeing the side of the donut. This side view allows us to see the intricate tendrils of material that have been compared to the eye&#39;s retina. In fact, IC 4406 is dubbed the &quot;Retina Nebula.&quot; The donut of material confines the intense radiation coming from the remnant of the dying star. Gas on the inside of the donut is ionized by light from the central star and glows. Light from oxygen atoms is rendered blue in this image; hydrogen is shown as green, and nitrogen as red. The range of color in the final image shows the differences in concentration of these three gases in the nebula. This image is a composite of data taken by HST&#39;s Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 in June 2001 and in January 2002 by Bob O&#39;Dell (Vanderbilt University) and collaborators, and in January by the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI). Filters used to create this color image show oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen gas glowing in this object.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2001-06-01T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Space Science</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203048/0203048~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203048/0203048~medium.jpg" alt="Space Science"></a><p>This sturning image, taken by the newly installed Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), is an image of the center of the Omega Nebula. It is a hotbed of newly born stars wrapped in colorful blankets of glowing gas and cradled in an enormous cold, dark hydrogen cloud. The region of nebula shown in this photograph is about 3,500 times wider than our solar system. The nebula, also called M17 and the Swan Nebula, resides 5,500 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius. The Swan Nebula is illuminated by ultraviolet radiation from young, massive stars, located just beyond the upper-right corner of the image. The powerful radiation from these stars evaporates and erodes the dense cloud of cold gas within which the stars formed. The blistered walls of the hollow cloud shine primarily in the blue, green, and red light emitted by excited atoms of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Particularly striking is the rose-like feature, seen to the right of center, which glows in the red light emitted by hydrogen and sulfur. As the infant stars evaporate the surrounding cloud, they expose dense pockets of gas that may contain developing stars. One isolated pocket is seen at the center of the brightest region of the nebula. Other dense pockets of gas have formed the remarkable feature jutting inward from the left edge of the image. The color image is constructed from four separate images taken in these filters: blue, near infrared, hydrogen alpha, and doubly ionized oxygen. Credit: NASA, H. Ford (JHU), G.

Called the Cone Nebula (NGC 2264), this giant pillar resides in a turbulent star-forming region. This picture, taken by the newly installed Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during Space Shuttle STS-109 mission in March 2002, shows the upper 2.5 light-years of the nebula, a height that equals 23 million roundtrips to the Moon. The entire nebula is 7 light-years long. The Cone Nebula resides 2,500 light-years away in the constellation Monoceros. Radiation from hot, young stars (located beyond the top of the image) has slowly eroded the nebula over millions of years. Ultraviolet light heats the edges of the dark cloud, releasing gas into the relatively empty region of surrounding space. There, additional ultraviolet radiation causes the hydrogen gas to glow, which produces the red halo of light seen around the pillar. A similar process occurs on a much smaller scale to gas surrounding a single star, forming the bow-shaped arc seen near the upper left side of the Cone. This arc, seen previously with the HST, is 65 times larger than the diameter of our solar system. The blue-white light from surrounding stars is reflected by dust. Background stars can be seen peeking through the evaporating tendrils of gas, while the turbulent base is pockmarked with stars reddened by dust. Credit: NASA, H. Ford (JHU), G.
