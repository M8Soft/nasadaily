The payload bay and tail of the shuttle can be seen on the left hand side of the picture. Auroras are caused when high-energy electrons pour down from the Earth&#39;s magnetosphere and collide with atoms. Red aurora occurs from 200 km to as high as 500 km altitude and is caused by the emission of 6300 Angstrom wavelength light from oxygen atoms. Green aurora occurs from about 100 km to 250 km altitude and is caused by the emission of 5577 Angstrom wavelength light from oxygen atoms. The light is emitted when the atoms return to their original unexcited state. At times of peaks in solar activity, there are more geomagnetic storms and this increases the auroral activity viewed on Earth and by astronauts from orbit.</p><p class="meta">Created: 1991-05-01T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0300804/0300804~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Aurora over Earth</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss059e001224/iss059e001224~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss059e001224/iss059e001224~medium.jpg" alt="Aurora over Earth"></a><p>iss059e001224 (March 19, 2019) --- City lights and the aurora are pictured during a nighttime pass as the International Space Station orbited 256 miles above Russia and Kazakhstan.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2019-03-19T00:00:00Z | Center: JSC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss059e001224/iss059e001224~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Landslides</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA08485/PIA08485~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA08485/PIA08485~medium.jpg" alt="Landslides"></a><p>The landslides in this image are located in Aurorae Chaos</p><p class="meta">Created: 2006-05-25T14:15:40Z | Center: JPL | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA08485/PIA08485~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>History of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0302061/0302061~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0302061/0302061~medium.jpg" alt="History of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)"></a><p>This is the first image of Saturn&#39;s ultraviolet aurora taken by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in October 1998, when Saturn was a distance of 810 million miles (1.3 billion kilometers) from Earth. The new instrument, used as a camera, provides more than 10 times the sensitivity of the previous HST instruments in the ultraviolet. STIS images reveal exquisite detail never before seen in the spectacular auroral curtains of light that encircle Saturn&#39;s north and south poles which rise more than a thousand miles above the cloud tops. Saturn&#39;s auroral displays are caused by an energetic wind from the Sun that sweeps over the planet, much like the Earth&#39;s aurora that is occasionally seen in the nighttime sky. Unlike the Earth, Saturn&#39;s aurora is only seen in ultraviolet light that is invisible from the Earth&#39;s surface, hence can only be observed from space.</p><p class="meta">Created: 1998-01-07T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0302061/0302061~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>KSC-06pd2789</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/KSC-06pd2789/KSC-06pd2789~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/KSC-06pd2789/KSC-06pd2789~medium.jpg" alt="KSC-06pd2789"></a><p>KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLA. --   At Astrotech Space Operations in Titusville, Fla., an overhead crane is in position to lift the crate from one of the components of the recently arrived THEMIS spacecraft.

This image of the nebula captured by NASA&#39;s Hubble Space Telescope (HST) depicts violent gas collisions that produced supersonic shock fronts in a dying star. Stars, like our sun, will eventually die and expel most of their material outward into shells of gas and dust These shells eventually form some of the most beautiful objects in the universe, called planetary nebulae. The yellow in the image depicts the material ejected from the central star zooming away at speeds up to one and a half million kilometers per hour (one million miles per hour). Due to the high speeds of the gas, shock-fronts are formed on impact and heat the surrounding gas. Although computer calculations have predicted the existence and structure of such shocks for some time, previous observations have not been able to prove the theory.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2001-08-24T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0300724/0300724~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Space Science</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" alt="Space Science"></a><p>This Hubble Space Telescope image reveals a rainbow of colors in this dying star, called IC 446. Like many other so-called planetary nebulae, IC 4406 exhibits a high degree of symmetry. The nebula&#39;s left and right halves are nearly mirror images of the other. If we could fly around IC 446 in a spaceship, we would see that the gas and dust form a vast donut of material streaming outward from the dying star. We do not see the donut shape in this photograph because we are viewing IC 4406 from the Earth-orbiting HST. From this vantage point, we are seeing the side of the donut. This side view allows us to see the intricate tendrils of material that have been compared to the eye&#39;s retina. In fact, IC 4406 is dubbed the &quot;Retina Nebula.&quot; The donut of material confines the intense radiation coming from the remnant of the dying star. Gas on the inside of the donut is ionized by light from the central star and glows. Light from oxygen atoms is rendered blue in this image; hydrogen is shown as green, and nitrogen as red. The range of color in the final image shows the differences in concentration of these three gases in the nebula. This image is a composite of data taken by HST&#39;s Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 in June 2001 and in January 2002 by Bob O&#39;Dell (Vanderbilt University) and collaborators, and in January by the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI).

It is a hotbed of newly born stars wrapped in colorful blankets of glowing gas and cradled in an enormous cold, dark hydrogen cloud. The region of nebula shown in this photograph is about 3,500 times wider than our solar system. The nebula, also called M17 and the Swan Nebula, resides 5,500 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius. The Swan Nebula is illuminated by ultraviolet radiation from young, massive stars, located just beyond the upper-right corner of the image. The powerful radiation from these stars evaporates and erodes the dense cloud of cold gas within which the stars formed. The blistered walls of the hollow cloud shine primarily in the blue, green, and red light emitted by excited atoms of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Particularly striking is the rose-like feature, seen to the right of center, which glows in the red light emitted by hydrogen and sulfur. As the infant stars evaporate the surrounding cloud, they expose dense pockets of gas that may contain developing stars. One isolated pocket is seen at the center of the brightest region of the nebula. Other dense pockets of gas have formed the remarkable feature jutting inward from the left edge of the image. The color image is constructed from four separate images taken in these filters: blue, near infrared, hydrogen alpha, and doubly ionized oxygen. Credit: NASA, H. Ford (JHU), G.

Called the Cone Nebula (NGC 2264), this giant pillar resides in a turbulent star-forming region. This picture, taken by the newly installed Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during Space Shuttle STS-109 mission in March 2002, shows the upper 2.5 light-years of the nebula, a height that equals 23 million roundtrips to the Moon. The entire nebula is 7 light-years long. The Cone Nebula resides 2,500 light-years away in the constellation Monoceros. Radiation from hot, young stars (located beyond the top of the image) has slowly eroded the nebula over millions of years. Ultraviolet light heats the edges of the dark cloud, releasing gas into the relatively empty region of surrounding space. There, additional ultraviolet radiation causes the hydrogen gas to glow, which produces the red halo of light seen around the pillar. A similar process occurs on a much smaller scale to gas surrounding a single star, forming the bow-shaped arc seen near the upper left side of the Cone. This arc, seen previously with the HST, is 65 times larger than the diameter of our solar system. The blue-white light from surrounding stars is reflected by dust. Background stars can be seen peeking through the evaporating tendrils of gas, while the turbulent base is pockmarked with stars reddened by dust. Credit: NASA, H. Ford (JHU), G.

Armstrong does a final check of his communications system before before the boarding of the Apollo 11 mission. Launched via a Saturn V launch vehicle, the first manned lunar mission launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on July 16, 1969 and safely returned to Earth on July 24, 1969. The Saturn V vehicle was developed by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) under the direction of Dr. Wernher von Braun. The 3-man crew aboard the flight consisted of astronauts Armstrong; Michael Collins, Command Module (CM) pilot; and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., Lunar Module (LM) Pilot.  Armstrong was the first human to ever stand on the lunar surface, followed by Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin. Meanwhile, astronaut Collins piloted the CM in a parking orbit around the Moon. During a 2? hour surface exploration, the crew collected 47 pounds of lunar surface material which was returned to Earth for analysis. With the success of Apollo 11, the national objective to land men on the Moon and return them safely to Earth had been accomplished. </p><p class="meta">Created: 1969-07-16T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/6900844/6900844~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Liftoff of the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/S69-39958/S69-39958~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/S69-39958/S69-39958~medium.jpg" alt="Liftoff of the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission"></a><p>S69-39958 (16 July 1969) --- A 70mm Airborne Lightweight Optical Tracking System (ALOTS) camera, mounted in a pod on a cargo door of a U.S. Air Force EC-135N aircraft, photographed this event in the early moments of the Apollo 11 launch.
