Mars 2020 will re-use the basic engineering of NASA&#39;s Mars Science Laboratory to send a different rover to Mars, with new objectives and instruments, launching in 2020. The rover will carry seven instruments to conduct its science and exploration technology investigations. They are:  Mastcam-Z, an advanced camera system with panoramic and stereoscopic imaging capability and the ability to zoom. The instrument also will determine mineralogy of the Martian surface and assist with rover operations. The principal investigator is James Bell, Arizona State University in Tempe.  SuperCam, an instrument that can provide imaging, chemical composition analysis, and mineralogy. The instrument will also be able to detect the presence of organic compounds in rocks and regolith from a distance. The principal investigator is Roger Wiens, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico. This instrument also has a significant contribution from the Centre National d&#39;Etudes Spatiales, Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Plan?tologie (CNES/IRAP) France.  Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL), an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer that will also contain an imager with high resolution to determine the fine-scale elemental composition of Martian surface materials. PIXL will provide capabilities that permit more detailed detection and analysis of chemical elements than ever before. The principal investigator is Abigail Allwood, NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.  Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman &amp; Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC), a spectrometer that will provide fine-scale imaging and uses an ultraviolet (UV) laser to determine fine-scale mineralogy and detect organic compounds. SHERLOC will be the first UV Raman spectrometer to fly to the surface of Mars and will provide complementary measurements with other instruments in the payload. SHERLOC includes a high-resolution color camera for microscopic imaging of Mars&#39; surface. The principal investigator is Luther Beegle, JPL.  The Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE), an exploration technology investigation that will produce oxygen from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide. The principal investigator is Michael Hecht, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA), a set of sensors that will provide measurements of temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, relative humidity and dust size and shape. The principal investigator is Jose Rodriguez-Manfredi, Centro de Astrobiologia, Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aeroespacial, Spain.  The Radar Imager for Mars&#39; Subsurface Experiment (RIMFAX), a ground-penetrating radar that will provide centimeter-scale resolution of the geologic structure of the subsurface. The principal investigator is Svein-Erik Hamran, the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Norway.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19672</p><p class="meta">Created: 2015-06-10T19:59:15Z | Center: JPL | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA19672/PIA19672~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Self-Portrait by Freshly Cleaned Opportunity Mars Rover, False Color</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA18080/PIA18080~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA18080/PIA18080~medium.jpg" alt="Self-Portrait by Freshly Cleaned Opportunity Mars Rover, False Color"></a><p>A false-color self-portrait of NASA Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity taken by the rover panoramic camera Pancam shows effects of recent winds removing much of the dust from the solar arrays.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2014-04-17T15:25:27Z | Center: JPL | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA18080/PIA18080~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>High Viewpoint for 11-Year-Old Rover Mission on Mars</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA19109/PIA19109~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA19109/PIA19109~medium.jpg" alt="High Viewpoint for 11-Year-Old Rover Mission on Mars"></a><p>This panorama is the view NASA Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity gained from the top of the Cape Tribulation segment of the rim of Endeavour Crater.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2015-01-22T19:37:27Z | Center: JPL | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA19109/PIA19109~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Blocky Rock is Exam Target for Mars Rover Opportunity</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA19146/PIA19146~small.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA19146/PIA19146~small.jpg" alt="Blocky Rock is Exam Target for Mars Rover Opportunity"></a><p>The flat-faced rock near the center of this image is a target for contact investigation by NASA&#39;s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity in early March 2015.

Photo experts at NASA studying the mission photography identify the airglow as being in the 80-120 kilometer altitude region and attribute its existence to atomic oxygen (wavelength of 5,577 Angstroms), although other atoms can also contribute. The atomic oxygen airglow is usually most intense at altitudes around 65 degrees north and south latitude, and is most intense in the spring and fall of the year. The aurora phenomena is due to atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen being excited by the particles from the Van Allen Radiation belts which extend between the two geomagnetic poles. The red and green rays appear to extend upward to 200-300 kilometers, much higher than the usual upper limits of about 110 kilometers.</p><p class="meta">Created: 1991-05-06T00:00:00Z | Center: JSC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/S39-342-026/S39-342-026~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Jupiter&#39;s Auroras Acceleration Processes</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA21937/PIA21937~thumb.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA21937/PIA21937~thumb.jpg" alt="Jupiter&#39;s Auroras Acceleration Processes"></a><p>This image, created with data from Juno&#39;s Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVS), marks the path of Juno&#39;s readings of Jupiter&#39;s auroras, highlighting the electron measurements that show the discovery of the so-called discrete auroral acceleration processes indicated by the &quot;inverted Vs&quot;? in the lower panel (Figure 1). This signature points to powerful magnetic-field-aligned electric potentials that accelerate electrons toward the atmosphere to energies that are far greater than what drive the most intense aurora at Earth.

The payload bay and tail of the shuttle can be seen on the left hand side of the picture. Auroras are caused when high-energy electrons pour down from the Earth&#39;s magnetosphere and collide with atoms. Red aurora occurs from 200 km to as high as 500 km altitude and is caused by the emission of 6300 Angstrom wavelength light from oxygen atoms. Green aurora occurs from about 100 km to 250 km altitude and is caused by the emission of 5577 Angstrom wavelength light from oxygen atoms. The light is emitted when the atoms return to their original unexcited state. At times of peaks in solar activity, there are more geomagnetic storms and this increases the auroral activity viewed on Earth and by astronauts from orbit.</p><p class="meta">Created: 1991-05-01T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0300804/0300804~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>STS-45 Earth observation of the Aurora Australis or Southern Lights</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/s45-31-012/s45-31-012~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/s45-31-012/s45-31-012~medium.jpg" alt="STS-45 Earth observation of the Aurora Australis or Southern Lights"></a><p>STS-45 Earth observation taken onboard Atlantis, Orbiter Vehicle (OV) 104, is of the Aurora Australis or Southern Lights.

The municipality of Dubai is the largest city of the Persian Gulf emirate of the same name, and has built a global reputation for large-scale developments and architectural works. Among the most visible of these developments -- particularly from the perspective of astronauts onboard the space station -- are three man-made archipelagos. The two Palm Islands -- Palm Jumeirah (right) and Palm Jebel Ali (out of frame further to the right) -- appear as stylized palm trees when viewed from above. The World Islands (center frame) evoke a rough map of the world from an air- or space-borne perspective. The Palm Jumeirah project began in 2001 and required more than 50 million cubic meters of dredged sand to raise the islands above the Persian Gulf sea level. Construction of the Palm Jumeirah islands was completed in 2006; for several years now they have been developed for residential and commercial housing and infrastructure. Creation of the World Islands was begun in 2003 and completed in 2008, using 320 million cubic meters of sand and 37 million tons of rock for the surrounding 27 kilometer-long protective breakwater.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2013-10-14T00:00:00Z | Center: JSC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss037e011470/iss037e011470~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Skylab (SL)-3 - East Africa View - Ravaged by Drought</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/s73-35082/s73-35082~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/s73-35082/s73-35082~medium.jpg" alt="Skylab (SL)-3 - East Africa View - Ravaged by Drought"></a><p>S73-35082 (July-Sept. 1973) --- A near vertical view of a portion of west Africa ravaged by drought for the past five years is seen in this Skylab 3 Earth Resources Experiments Package S190-B (five-inch Earth terrain camera) photograph taken from the Skylab space station in Earth orbit. The semi-desert scene is in southeastern Niger about 200 nautical miles east-northeast of the capital city of Niamey. A polygonal-shaped area (dark) in the lower right corner of the picture represents a range-management ranch.  The dry stream beds trending diagonally across the photograph locally contain some water or vegetation (green). The beds are sources of water through shallow drilling and contain soils suitable for production of crops. The variety of tans, browns and grays are typical desert colors that represent barren rocks and soil or sand-filled ancient stream valleys.  Absence of vegetation is the singular feature of the area. Dr. G. Stuckmann of the Geographic Institute, University of Technology, Mannover, Federal Republic of Germany, will use this photograph in the study of the hydrologic regime of the region through analysis of fossil drainage patterns, geological structures and accumulations of surface water. Federal agencies participating with NASA on the EREP project are the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Corps of Engineers.

The nebula, also known as the Swan Nebula, is a hotbed of newly born stars residing 5,500 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius. The wavelike patterns of gas have been sculpted and illuminated by a torrent of ultraviolet radiation from the young massive stars, which lie outside the picture to the upper left. The ultraviolet radiation is carving and heating the surfaces of cold hydrogen gas clouds. The warmed surfaces glow orange and red in this photograph.

This image of the nebula captured by NASA&#39;s Hubble Space Telescope (HST) depicts violent gas collisions that produced supersonic shock fronts in a dying star. Stars, like our sun, will eventually die and expel most of their material outward into shells of gas and dust These shells eventually form some of the most beautiful objects in the universe, called planetary nebulae. The yellow in the image depicts the material ejected from the central star zooming away at speeds up to one and a half million kilometers per hour (one million miles per hour). Due to the high speeds of the gas, shock-fronts are formed on impact and heat the surrounding gas. Although computer calculations have predicted the existence and structure of such shocks for some time, previous observations have not been able to prove the theory.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2001-08-24T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0300724/0300724~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Space Science</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" alt="Space Science"></a><p>This Hubble Space Telescope image reveals a rainbow of colors in this dying star, called IC 446. Like many other so-called planetary nebulae, IC 4406 exhibits a high degree of symmetry. The nebula&#39;s left and right halves are nearly mirror images of the other. If we could fly around IC 446 in a spaceship, we would see that the gas and dust form a vast donut of material streaming outward from the dying star. We do not see the donut shape in this photograph because we are viewing IC 4406 from the Earth-orbiting HST. From this vantage point, we are seeing the side of the donut. This side view allows us to see the intricate tendrils of material that have been compared to the eye&#39;s retina. In fact, IC 4406 is dubbed the &quot;Retina Nebula.&quot; The donut of material confines the intense radiation coming from the remnant of the dying star. Gas on the inside of the donut is ionized by light from the central star and glows. Light from oxygen atoms is rendered blue in this image; hydrogen is shown as green, and nitrogen as red. The range of color in the final image shows the differences in concentration of these three gases in the nebula. This image is a composite of data taken by HST&#39;s Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 in June 2001 and in January 2002 by Bob O&#39;Dell (Vanderbilt University) and collaborators, and in January by the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI). Filters used to create this color image show oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen gas glowing in this object.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2001-06-01T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Space Science</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203048/0203048~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203048/0203048~medium.jpg" alt="Space Science"></a><p>This sturning image, taken by the newly installed Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), is an image of the center of the Omega Nebula. It is a hotbed of newly born stars wrapped in colorful blankets of glowing gas and cradled in an enormous cold, dark hydrogen cloud. The region of nebula shown in this photograph is about 3,500 times wider than our solar system. The nebula, also called M17 and the Swan Nebula, resides 5,500 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius. The Swan Nebula is illuminated by ultraviolet radiation from young, massive stars, located just beyond the upper-right corner of the image. The powerful radiation from these stars evaporates and erodes the dense cloud of cold gas within which the stars formed. The blistered walls of the hollow cloud shine primarily in the blue, green, and red light emitted by excited atoms of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Particularly striking is the rose-like feature, seen to the right of center, which glows in the red light emitted by hydrogen and sulfur. As the infant stars evaporate the surrounding cloud, they expose dense pockets of gas that may contain developing stars. One isolated pocket is seen at the center of the brightest region of the nebula. Other dense pockets of gas have formed the remarkable feature jutting inward from the left edge of the image. The color image is constructed from four separate images taken in these filters: blue, near infrared, hydrogen alpha, and doubly ionized oxygen. Credit: NASA, H. Ford (JHU), G.
