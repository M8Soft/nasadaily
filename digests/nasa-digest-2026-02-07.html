The payload bay and tail of the shuttle can be seen on the left hand side of the picture. Auroras are caused when high-energy electrons pour down from the Earth&#39;s magnetosphere and collide with atoms. Red aurora occurs from 200 km to as high as 500 km altitude and is caused by the emission of 6300 Angstrom wavelength light from oxygen atoms. Green aurora occurs from about 100 km to 250 km altitude and is caused by the emission of 5577 Angstrom wavelength light from oxygen atoms. The light is emitted when the atoms return to their original unexcited state. At times of peaks in solar activity, there are more geomagnetic storms and this increases the auroral activity viewed on Earth and by astronauts from orbit.</p><p class="meta">Created: 1991-05-01T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0300804/0300804~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Earth Observations taken by the Expedition 39 Crew</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss039e009160/iss039e009160~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss039e009160/iss039e009160~medium.jpg" alt="Earth Observations taken by the Expedition 39 Crew"></a><p>ISS039-E-009160 (2 April 2014) --- This nighttime view featuring the aurora borealis, the moon and Moscow was photographed by an Expedition 39 crew member on the International Space Station.

The image, taken July 6 from a vantage point one million miles from Earth, was one of the first taken by NASA?s Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC).  Central Europe is toward the top of the image with the Sahara Desert to the south, showing the Nile River flowing to the Mediterranean Sea through Egypt. The photographic-quality color image was generated by combining three separate images of the entire Earth taken a few minutes apart. The camera takes a series of 10 images using different narrowband filters -- from ultraviolet to near infrared -- to produce a variety of science products. The red, green and blue channel images are used in these Earth images.  The DSCOVR mission is a partnership between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force, with the primary objective to maintain the nation?s real-time solar wind monitoring capabilities, which are critical to the accuracy and lead time of space weather alerts and forecasts from NOAA.  DSCOVR was launched in February to its planned orbit at the first Lagrange point or L1, about one million miles from Earth toward the sun. It?s from that unique vantage point that the EPIC instrument is acquiring images of the entire sunlit face of Earth. Data from EPIC will be used to measure ozone and aerosol levels in Earth?s atmosphere, cloud height, vegetation properties and a variety of other features.

The nebula, also known as the Swan Nebula, is a hotbed of newly born stars residing 5,500 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius. The wavelike patterns of gas have been sculpted and illuminated by a torrent of ultraviolet radiation from the young massive stars, which lie outside the picture to the upper left. The ultraviolet radiation is carving and heating the surfaces of cold hydrogen gas clouds. The warmed surfaces glow orange and red in this photograph. The green represents an even hotter gas that masks background structures.

This image of the nebula captured by NASA&#39;s Hubble Space Telescope (HST) depicts violent gas collisions that produced supersonic shock fronts in a dying star. Stars, like our sun, will eventually die and expel most of their material outward into shells of gas and dust These shells eventually form some of the most beautiful objects in the universe, called planetary nebulae. The yellow in the image depicts the material ejected from the central star zooming away at speeds up to one and a half million kilometers per hour (one million miles per hour). Due to the high speeds of the gas, shock-fronts are formed on impact and heat the surrounding gas. Although computer calculations have predicted the existence and structure of such shocks for some time, previous observations have not been able to prove the theory.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2001-08-24T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0300724/0300724~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Space Science</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" alt="Space Science"></a><p>This Hubble Space Telescope image reveals a rainbow of colors in this dying star, called IC 446. Like many other so-called planetary nebulae, IC 4406 exhibits a high degree of symmetry. The nebula&#39;s left and right halves are nearly mirror images of the other. If we could fly around IC 446 in a spaceship, we would see that the gas and dust form a vast donut of material streaming outward from the dying star. We do not see the donut shape in this photograph because we are viewing IC 4406 from the Earth-orbiting HST. From this vantage point, we are seeing the side of the donut. This side view allows us to see the intricate tendrils of material that have been compared to the eye&#39;s retina. In fact, IC 4406 is dubbed the &quot;Retina Nebula.&quot; The donut of material confines the intense radiation coming from the remnant of the dying star. Gas on the inside of the donut is ionized by light from the central star and glows. Light from oxygen atoms is rendered blue in this image; hydrogen is shown as green, and nitrogen as red. The range of color in the final image shows the differences in concentration of these three gases in the nebula. This image is a composite of data taken by HST&#39;s Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 in June 2001 and in January 2002 by Bob O&#39;Dell (Vanderbilt University) and collaborators, and in January by the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI). Filters used to create this color image show oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen gas glowing in this object.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2001-06-01T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Space Science</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203048/0203048~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203048/0203048~medium.jpg" alt="Space Science"></a><p>This sturning image, taken by the newly installed Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), is an image of the center of the Omega Nebula.

The nebula, also called M17 and the Swan Nebula, resides 5,500 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius. The Swan Nebula is illuminated by ultraviolet radiation from young, massive stars, located just beyond the upper-right corner of the image. The powerful radiation from these stars evaporates and erodes the dense cloud of cold gas within which the stars formed. The blistered walls of the hollow cloud shine primarily in the blue, green, and red light emitted by excited atoms of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Particularly striking is the rose-like feature, seen to the right of center, which glows in the red light emitted by hydrogen and sulfur. As the infant stars evaporate the surrounding cloud, they expose dense pockets of gas that may contain developing stars. One isolated pocket is seen at the center of the brightest region of the nebula. Other dense pockets of gas have formed the remarkable feature jutting inward from the left edge of the image. The color image is constructed from four separate images taken in these filters: blue, near infrared, hydrogen alpha, and doubly ionized oxygen. Credit: NASA, H. Ford (JHU), G.

Astronaut David R. Scott waits in the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) for astronaut James Irwin for the return trip to the Lunar Module, Falcon, with rocks and soil collected near the Hadley-Apernine landing site. The Apollo 15 was the first mission to use the LRV. Powered by battery, the lightweight electric car greatly increased the range of mobility and productivity on the scientific traverses for astronauts. It weighed 462 pounds (77 pounds on the Moon) and could carry two suited astronauts, their gear and cameras, and several hundred pounds of bagged samples. The LRV&#39;s mobility was quite high. It could climb and descend slopes of about 25 degrees. The LRV was designed and developed by the Marshall Space Flight Center and built by the Boeing Company. </p><p class="meta">Created: 1971-08-01T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/7022567/7022567~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Clifford Charlesworth seated at his console in Mission Control Room</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/S68-55742/S68-55742~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/S68-55742/S68-55742~medium.jpg" alt="Clifford Charlesworth seated at his console in Mission Control Room"></a><p>S68-55742 (21 Dec. 1968) --- Clifford E.
