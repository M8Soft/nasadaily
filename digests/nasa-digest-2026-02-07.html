The payload bay and tail of the shuttle can be seen on the left hand side of the picture. Auroras are caused when high-energy electrons pour down from the Earth&#39;s magnetosphere and collide with atoms. Red aurora occurs from 200 km to as high as 500 km altitude and is caused by the emission of 6300 Angstrom wavelength light from oxygen atoms. Green aurora occurs from about 100 km to 250 km altitude and is caused by the emission of 5577 Angstrom wavelength light from oxygen atoms. The light is emitted when the atoms return to their original unexcited state. At times of peaks in solar activity, there are more geomagnetic storms and this increases the auroral activity viewed on Earth and by astronauts from orbit.</p><p class="meta">Created: 1991-05-01T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0300804/0300804~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Dance of Saturn Auroras</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA17900/PIA17900~small.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA17900/PIA17900~small.jpg" alt="Dance of Saturn Auroras"></a><p>Ultraviolet and infrared images from NASA Cassini spacecraft and Hubble Space Telescope show active and quiet auroras at Saturn north and south poles.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2014-02-11T15:20:03Z | Center: JPL | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA17900/PIA17900~small.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Space Science</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/9513744/9513744~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/9513744/9513744~medium.jpg" alt="Space Science"></a><p>This photograph of aurora borealis, northern aurora, was taken during the Spacelab-J (SL-J) mission (STS-47).

Polar mesospheric clouds?also known as noctilucent, or ?night shining? clouds?are formed 76 to 85 kilometers above Earth?s surface near the mesosphere-thermosphere boundary of the atmosphere, a region known as the mesopause. At these altitudes, water vapor can freeze into clouds of ice crystals. When the sun is below the horizon such that the ground is in darkness, these high clouds may still be illuminated?lending them their ethereal, ?night shining? qualities. Noctilucent clouds have been observed from all human vantage points in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres ? from the surface, in aircraft, and in orbit from the space station?and tend to be most visible during the late spring and early summer seasons. Polar mesospheric clouds also are of interest to scientists studying the atmosphere. While some scientists seek to understand their mechanisms of formation, others have identified them as potential indicators of atmospheric changes resulting from increases in greenhouse gas concentrations. This photograph was taken when the station was over the Pacific Ocean south of French Polynesia. While most polar mesospheric cloud images are taken from the orbital complex with relatively short focal length lens to maximize the field of view, this image was taken with a long lens (400 mm) allowing for additional detail of the cloud forms to be seen. Below the brightly-lit noctilucent clouds in the center of the image, the pale orange band indicates the stratosphere.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2013-01-05T00:00:00Z | Center: JSC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss034e024622/iss034e024622~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Test launch of a Topol/SS-25 missile</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss037e009296/iss037e009296~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss037e009296/iss037e009296~medium.jpg" alt="Test launch of a Topol/SS-25 missile"></a><p>ISS037-E-009296 (10 Oct. 2013) --- This is one of a series of views that captured a missile launch from Earth as seen on Oct. 10, 2013 by the Expedition 37 crew aboard the International Space Station.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2013-10-10T00:00:00Z | Center: JSC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss037e009296/iss037e009296~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Test launch of a Topol/SS-25 missile</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss037e009224/iss037e009224~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss037e009224/iss037e009224~medium.jpg" alt="Test launch of a Topol/SS-25 missile"></a><p>ISS037-E-009224 (10 Oct. 2013) --- This is one of a series of views that captured a missile launch from Earth as seen on Oct. 10, 2013 by the Expedition 37 crew aboard the International Space Station.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2013-10-10T00:00:00Z | Center: JSC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss037e009224/iss037e009224~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Kennedy Space Center area as seen from Gemini 7 during Gemini 6 abort</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/s65-63771/s65-63771~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/s65-63771/s65-63771~medium.jpg" alt="Kennedy Space Center area as seen from Gemini 7 during Gemini 6 abort"></a><p>S65-63771 (12 Dec. 1965) --- Kennedy Space Center area on the east coast of Florida as seen from the Gemini-7 spacecraft, during Gemini-6 abort, on its 118th revolution of Earth.

This image of the nebula captured by NASA&#39;s Hubble Space Telescope (HST) depicts violent gas collisions that produced supersonic shock fronts in a dying star. Stars, like our sun, will eventually die and expel most of their material outward into shells of gas and dust These shells eventually form some of the most beautiful objects in the universe, called planetary nebulae. The yellow in the image depicts the material ejected from the central star zooming away at speeds up to one and a half million kilometers per hour (one million miles per hour). Due to the high speeds of the gas, shock-fronts are formed on impact and heat the surrounding gas. Although computer calculations have predicted the existence and structure of such shocks for some time, previous observations have not been able to prove the theory.</p><p class="meta">Created: 2001-08-24T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0300724/0300724~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Space Science</h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/0203044/0203044~medium.jpg" alt="Space Science"></a><p>This Hubble Space Telescope image reveals a rainbow of colors in this dying star, called IC 446. Like many other so-called planetary nebulae, IC 4406 exhibits a high degree of symmetry. The nebula&#39;s left and right halves are nearly mirror images of the other. If we could fly around IC 446 in a spaceship, we would see that the gas and dust form a vast donut of material streaming outward from the dying star. We do not see the donut shape in this photograph because we are viewing IC 4406 from the Earth-orbiting HST. From this vantage point, we are seeing the side of the donut. This side view allows us to see the intricate tendrils of material that have been compared to the eye&#39;s retina. In fact, IC 4406 is dubbed the &quot;Retina Nebula.&quot; The donut of material confines the intense radiation coming from the remnant of the dying star. Gas on the inside of the donut is ionized by light from the central star and glows. Light from oxygen atoms is rendered blue in this image; hydrogen is shown as green, and nitrogen as red. The range of color in the final image shows the differences in concentration of these three gases in the nebula. This image is a composite of data taken by HST&#39;s Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 in June 2001 and in January 2002 by Bob O&#39;Dell (Vanderbilt University) and collaborators, and in January by the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI).

It is a hotbed of newly born stars wrapped in colorful blankets of glowing gas and cradled in an enormous cold, dark hydrogen cloud. The region of nebula shown in this photograph is about 3,500 times wider than our solar system. The nebula, also called M17 and the Swan Nebula, resides 5,500 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius. The Swan Nebula is illuminated by ultraviolet radiation from young, massive stars, located just beyond the upper-right corner of the image. The powerful radiation from these stars evaporates and erodes the dense cloud of cold gas within which the stars formed. The blistered walls of the hollow cloud shine primarily in the blue, green, and red light emitted by excited atoms of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Particularly striking is the rose-like feature, seen to the right of center, which glows in the red light emitted by hydrogen and sulfur. As the infant stars evaporate the surrounding cloud, they expose dense pockets of gas that may contain developing stars. One isolated pocket is seen at the center of the brightest region of the nebula. Other dense pockets of gas have formed the remarkable feature jutting inward from the left edge of the image. The color image is constructed from four separate images taken in these filters: blue, near infrared, hydrogen alpha, and doubly ionized oxygen. Credit: NASA, H. Ford (JHU), G.

When stars that are around the mass of the sun reach their final stages of life, they shed their outer layers into space, which appear as glowing clouds of gas called planetary nebulae. The ejection of mass in stellar burnout is irregular and not symmetrical, so that planetary nebulae can have very complex shapes. In the case of Menzel 2 the nebula forms a winding blue cloud that perfectly aligns with two stars at its center. In 1999 astronomers discovered that the star at the upper right is in fact the central star of the nebula, and the star to the lower left is probably a true physical companion of the central star.  For tens of thousands of years the stellar core will be cocooned in spectacular clouds of gas and then, over a period of a few thousand years, the gas will fade away into the depths of the universe. The curving structure of Menzel 2 resembles a last goodbye before the star reaches its final stage of retirement as a white dwarf.

The first manned lunar mission, the Apollo 11 launched aboard a Saturn V launch vehicle from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on July 16, 1969 and safely returned to Earth on July 24, 1969. The 3-man crew aboard the flight consisted of Neil A, Armstrong, mission commander; Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., Lunar Module Pilot; and Michael Collins, Command Module pilot. The LM landed on the moon?s surface on July 20, 1969 in the region known as Mare Tranquilitatis (the Sea of Tranquility).  Armstrong was the first human to ever stand on the lunar surface. As he stepped off the LM, Armstrong proclaimed, ?That?s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind?. He was followed by Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin, describing the lunar surface as Magnificent desolation.  Astronaut Collins piloted the Command Module in a parking orbit around the Moon. The crew collected 47 pounds of lunar surface material which was returned to Earth for analysis. The surface exploration was concluded in 2? hours. With the success of Apollo 11, the national objective to land men on the Moon and return them safely to Earth had been accomplished. The Saturn V vehicle was developed by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) under the direction of Dr. von Braun.</p><p class="meta">Created: 1969-07-20T00:00:00Z | Center: MSFC | Source: <a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/6901250/6901250~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a></p></div><div class="item"><h3>Apollo 9 Mission image - Lunar Module </h3><a href="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/as09-21-3183/as09-21-3183~medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/as09-21-3183/as09-21-3183~medium.jpg" alt="Apollo 9 Mission image - Lunar Module "></a><p>AS09-21-3183 (7 March 1969) --- A view of the Apollo 9 Lunar Module (LM) &quot;Spider&quot; in a lunar landing configuration, as photographed from the Command and Service Modules (CSM) on the fifth day of the Apollo 9 Earth-orbital mission.
